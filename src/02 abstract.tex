    The Kauffman bracket skein algebra (KBSA) of an oriented surface
    $\Sigma$ is defined as the free algebra spanned by diagrams of
    unoriented framed links in $\Sigma$ modulo the Kauffman
    bracket relations with multiplication defined by stacking diagrams using over crossings.
    One particular modification of this construction is 
    obtained by instead considering the free algebra spanned by 
    trivalent graphs embedded in $\Sigma$ modulo the Yamada 
    relations. This algebra is called the graph skein algebra of 
    $\Sigma$. In this paper we describe finite presentations for the graph skein algebras 
    of the torus, the punctured torus, and the T-shirt. 
    Additonally, we fully describe multiplication in the graph 
    skein algebra of the torus, and show that the graph skein algebras of
    the punctured torus and T-shirt embed into their respective 
    KBSAs. We show that this fails for the graph skein algebra of the torus, 
    which is the first instance of this failing in the literature.

        Some of this could be good for the introduction in the report!

        The Kauffman bracket skein algebra (KBSA) of an oriented
        surface $\Sigma$ (denoted by $S_q(\Sigma)$ in this paper)
        is the free algebra spanned by diagrams of unoriented framed
        links in $\Sigma$ modulo the Kauffmman bracket relations with
        multiplication defined by stacking diagrams using over crossings.
        Due to work by Khovanov and Frenkel, it is known that $S_q(\mathbb{R}^2)$ is exactly
        the diagrammatic calculus of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ intertwiners.
        The diagrammatic calculus of $U_q(\mathfrak{pgl}_2)$ intertwiners
        is given by the free algebra spanned by diagrams of trivalent ribbon
        graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$ modulo the Yamada relations. In this way,
        one can generalize the notion of the KBSA of an oriented surface
        $\Sigma$ to the so-called graph skein algebra (otherwise known as the
        chromatic, or $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ skein algebra) of $\Sigma$ denoted
        $S_q^Y(\Sigma)$. It is conjectured that the homomorphism
        $JW: S_q^Y(\Sigma) \to S_q(\Sigma)$ defined by cableing Jones-Wenzl
        indempotents on two strands is injective for all $\Sigma$.
        In this paper, we prove that $JW$ is injective for all oriented
        surfaces with boundary, and not injective for the torus.
        We then compute finite presentations for the graph skein algebras of the torus,
        the punctured torus, and the T-shirt, along with a multiplication
        table for the torus.
