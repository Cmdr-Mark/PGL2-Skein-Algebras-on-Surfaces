    The Kauffman bracket skein algebra (KBSA) of an oriented surface
    $\Sigma$ is defined as the free algebra spanned by diagrams of
    unoriented framed links in $\Sigma$ modulo the Kauffman
    bracket relations with multiplication defined by stacking diagrams using over crossings.
    One particular modification of this construction is 
    obtained by instead considering the free algebra spanned by 
    trivalent graphs embedded in $\Sigma$ modulo a different set of 
    relations. This algebra is called the graph skein algebra of 
    $\Sigma$. In this paper we describe bases for the graph skein algebras 
    of the torus, the punctured torus, and the T-shirt. 
    Additonally, we fully describe multiplication in the graph 
    skein algebra of the torus, and show that the graph skein algebras of
    the punctured torus and T-shirt embed into their respective 
    KBSAs. We show that this fails for the graph skein algebra of the torus, 
    which is the first instance of this failing in the literature.
