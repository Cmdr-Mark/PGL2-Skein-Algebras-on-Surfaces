    The Kauffman bracket skein algebra (KBSA) of a 3-manifold $M$ --- defined as the free algebra generated by unoriented framed links in $M$
    modulo the Kauffman relations --- is generally an object of interest in the study of quantum topology. One particular
    modification to this construction is to consider instead the free algebra generated by trivalent graphs embedded in $M$ modulo
    a different set of relations. This algebra is called the graph skein algebra of $M$. In this paper we describe bases and
    multiplication in the graph skein algebras of the torus, the punctured torus, and the tee-shirt. We also prove that the graph skein
    algebras of the punctured torus and tee-shirt embed into their respective KBSAs, but that the torus does not.
